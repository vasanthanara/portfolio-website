As part of my internship at CodTech, I built a personal portfolio website using modern web technologies.
The main aim was to design a clean, responsive, and animated site that highlights my skills and academic background.

Technologies Used:
HTML – for webpage structure
CSS – for styling, layout, and hover effects
JavaScript – for interactivity and logic
GSAP – to create smooth, modern animations
GitHub – for version control and project hosting

Mobile-Friendly Design that works on all screen sizes
Smooth Animations on page load using GSAP
Interactive Cards and clean layout with soft UI
LinkedIn Icon Link for professional profile access
Organized Sections like About, Skills, Projects, and Contact

This project helped me apply frontend skills in a real-world task. I learned how to combine design and animation for a better user experience.
The portfolio also works as an online resume and personal branding tool.
